### Overview

This schema will get user details and repositories from GitHub. It requires a [GitHub personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens), which is necessary for access to the GitHub API. For a full tutorial on importing schemas into your StepZen project, the main [Readme](https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas) of this repository provides step-by-step instructions to do so.

## Preparing your Github Configuration

<em>First step to importing a schema into your StepZen SDL (Schema Definition Language) is to prepare the API for import. If you already have your API configurations, [skip](#import) this section.</em>

1. Register a personal token, https://github.com/settings/tokens.
2. Add read/write permissions.  

## StepZen Import <a href="import"></a>
<em>The StepZen CLI will import the schema and request your authentication configurations. You can add the configurations in the command line or add the configurations after import.</em>

1. Before importing the schema, either create a new project or access your existing project in the command line.

Creating a new StepZen SDL project.
```bash
$ mkdir my-app
$ cd my-app
```

Access an existing project
```bash
$ cd my-existing-project
```

2. Importing the schema.  As mentioned earlier, you can skip the configuration questions by pressing `[Enter]` and adding the configurations manually.

```bash
$ stepzen import github
```

3. Now the project should include the following directory layout in your root folder.  Add your credentials in the config.yaml to properly deploy the StepZen Endpoint.

```shell
üêí‚ûî tree
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.graphql
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ github
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ github.graphql
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1 directories, 4 files
```

The config.yaml configuration for github.
```bash
  - configuration:  
      name: github_config
      Authorization: Bearer {{bearer_token}}
```

4. Start up the StepZen Endpoint. Provide the directory path to deploy your endpoint appropriately.  
<em>https://accountname.stepzen.net/foo/bar/__graphql</em>


```bash
$ stepzen start foo/bar
```
A successfull deploy should respond with the below CLI message. If it did not successfully deploy, post on [Github Issues](https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas/issues)
```bash
Watching /Users/username/Desktop/myapp/config.yaml for configuration changes
Watching /Users/username/Desktop/myapp for GraphQL changes

http://localhost:5000/foo/bar
Deploying to StepZen...... done

Successfully deployed foo/bar at 8:06:59 AM

Your endpoint is available at https://accountname.stepzen.net/foo/bar/__graphql
```

Done! The StepZen Dashboard should be deployed at `http://localhost:5000/foo/bar` with an explorer listing the query documentation. üöÄ
