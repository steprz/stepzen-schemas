# Holiday schema

This schema provides the ability to fetch the list of holidays using month, year and a two digit country code. It uses [HolidayAPI](https://holidayapi.com) as the backend. It defines:

- a Holiday interface for delivery information in the file `Holiday.graphql`.
- one concrete type, HolidayAPI that implements the Holiday interface using HolidayAPI (`HolidayAPI.graphql`).
