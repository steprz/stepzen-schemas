### Overview

For a full tutorial on importing schemas into your StepZen project, the main [Readme](https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas) of this repository provides step-by-step instructions to do so.

Power your insurance industry billing and patient experience from Eligible.

This schema will include authentication to an endpoint through the Eligible REST API to query instances from a fixed Eligible schema.

## What comes with the Eligible backend <a name="context"></a>

1. Designed for security, privacy, and compliance.
2. All-in-one platform for payments, claims, and insurance verficiations.

## Preparing your Eligible Configuration

<em>First step to importing a schema into your StepZen SDL (Schema Definition Language) is to prepare the API for import. If you already have your API configurations, [skip](#import) this section.</em>

1. Create an account which does require payment information
2. Go to account and generate a new api key using the account password, https://account.eligible.com/profile/access_keys. Keep in mind that the retrieval of test data carries the utm parameter ?test=true

```bash
https://gds.eligibleapi.com/v1.5/claims/$claimsId/payment_reports/$paymentReportId?api_key=$api_key&test=true
```

## StepZen Import <a href="import"></a>

<em>The StepZen CLI will import the schema and request your authentication configurations. You can add the configurations in the command line or add the configurations after import.</em>

1. Before importing the schema, either create a new project or access your existing project in the command line.

Creating a new StepZen SDL project.

```bash
$ mkdir my-app
$ cd my-app
```

Access an existing project

```bash
$ cd my-existing-project
```

2. Importing the schema. As mentioned earlier, you can skip the configuration questions by pressing `[Enter]` and adding the configurations manually.

```bash
$ stepzen import eligible
```

3. Now the project should include the following directory layout in your root folder. Add your credentials in the config.yaml to properly deploy the StepZen Endpoint.

```shell
🐒➔ tree
.
├── index.graphql
├── config.yaml
└── eligible
    ├── eligible.graphql
    └── README.md

1 directories, 4 files
```

The config.yaml configuration for eligible.

```bash
  - configuration:
      name: eligible_config
      api_key: {{ api_key }}
```

4. Start up the StepZen Endpoint.

```bash
$ stepzen start
```

A successfull deploy should respond with the below CLI message. If it did not successfully deploy, post on [Github Issues](https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas/issues)

```bash
Watching /Users/username/Desktop/myapp/config.yaml for configuration changes
Watching /Users/username/Desktop/myapp for GraphQL changes

http://localhost:5000/foo/bar
Deploying to StepZen...... done

Successfully deployed foo/bar at 8:06:59 AM

Your endpoint is available at https://accountname.stepzen.net/foo/bar/__graphql
```

Done! The StepZen Dashboard should be deployed at `http://localhost:5000/foo/bar` with an explorer listing the query documentation. 🚀
